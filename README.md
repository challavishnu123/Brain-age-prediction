# Brain Age Prediction using Deep Learning Approaches

In brain imaging research, removing faces from 3D MRI scans (defacing) has become standard to protect data privacy, especially in large, multi-site studies. However, defacing may remove useful information. This study evaluates how defacing affects brain age prediction, a task where models estimate a personâ€™s age based on their brain MRI. Four defacing methods were tested, comparing defaced scans, brain-extracted scans, and scans with both brain and face data. Results showed that defacing impacts the accuracy of brain age predictions, depending on the method used. Interestingly, CNNs performed well when predicting age using only facial data. The difference between predicted brain age and their actual chronological age can offer meaningful information about their brain health and the aging process.. Deep learning can accurately predict an individual's chronological age from T1-weighted MRI brain images, offering a biomarker known as brain age, which can be used to study brain maturation, degeneration, and early detection of brain diseases. The model adjusts the weights of these algorithms based on age, improving prediction accuracy. When the model demonstrated a lower mean absolute error , showcasing greater accuracy compared to individual models. This method could enhance brain age prediction for medical purposes like rehabilitation prognosis and treatment trials.
